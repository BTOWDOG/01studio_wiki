# linear regression fast（Line patrol）

## Foreword
Fast linear regression has a wide range of uses, such as the cars and robots that are often used in competitions to patrol the line. They can use linear regression to determine the trajectory of the dotted and solid lines, and thus make judgments and responses. In this section, we will learn the programming method of CanMV K230 linear regression.

## Experiment Purpose
Through programming, CanMV K230 can detect and identify the solid lines (or dotted lines) in the image and draw a picture to indicate them.

## Experimental Explanation

CanMV integrates the fast linear regression get_regression function, which is located under the image module, so we can directly process the captured pictures. Then we look at the function description as usual, as follows:

## class get_regression

### Constructors
```python
image.get_regression(thresholds[, invert=False[, roi[, x_stride=2[, y_stride=1[, 
                    area_threshold=10[, pixels_threshold=10[, robust=False]]]]]]])
```
Linear regression calculation. Perform linear regression calculation on all threshold pixels in the image using the least squares method. This is usually faster, but cannot handle any outliers.

Parameter Description:
- `threshold`: Must be a list of tuples. (lo, hi) defines the color range you want to track. For grayscale images, each tuple needs to contain two values: the minimum grayscale value and the maximum grayscale value.

### Methods

Call the function directly.

For more usage, please read: [CanMV K230 Docs](https://www.kendryte.com/k230_canmv/zh/main/api/openmv/image.html#get-regression)


In order to improve the processing effect, we can first convert the image into a binary (black and white) image. The method is as follows:

```python
image.binary(thresholds[, invert=False[, zero=False[, mask=None[, to_bitmap=False[, copy=False]]]]])
```

Linear regression calculation. Perform linear regression calculation on all threshold pixels in the image using the least squares method. This is usually faster, but cannot handle any outliers.

- `threshold`: Must be a list of tuples. (lo, hi) defines the color range you want to track. For grayscale images, each tuple needs to contain two values: the minimum grayscale value and the maximum grayscale value.

For example: thresholds=(0,100), then this function means changing the grayscale value range of (0,100) to white.

    img = sensor.snapshot().binary([THRESHOLD]) if BINARY_VISIBLE else sensor.snapshot()

    # Returns an object similar to find_lines() and find_line_segments().
    # The following functions are used: x1(), y1(), x2(), y2(), length(),
    # theta() (rotation in degrees), rho(), and magnitude().
    #
    # magnitude() represents the linear regression instruction, and its value is (0, INF].
    # 0 represents a circle, and the larger the INF value, the better the linear fit effect.

    line = img.get_regression([(255,255) if BINARY_VISIBLE else THRESHOLD])

    if (line):

        img.draw_line(line.line(), color = 127,thickness=4)

        print(line) #Printing Results

    #Display images, only used for LCD center display
    Display.show_image(img, x=round((lcd_width-sensor.width())/2),y=round((lcd_height-sensor.height())/2))


    print("FPS %f, mag = %s" % (clock.fps(), str(line.magnitude()) if (line) else "N/A"))

## Experimental Results

Run the code in CanMV IDE, and the detection and recognition results are as follows:

### Dashed Line Test

### Solid curve test

Original image:

![linear](./img/linear/linear4.png) 

Identification results:

![linear](./img/linear/linear4_1.png)

You can see the recognition results in the serial terminal:

![linear](./img/linear/linear5.png)

The above results contain the coordinates of the two points of the fitted line segment, the length, and the very important `theta` angle information. The `theta` angle is expressed as follows:

![linear](./img/linear/linear6.png)

From left to right, the changes are 91°->180°(0°)->90°. You can observe the experimental data in the figure above to understand that the essence of the line patrol car is to keep this fitting line segment at 0°.
